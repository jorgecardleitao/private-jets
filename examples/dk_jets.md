# Use of Danish private jets

{from_date} to {to_date}, Danish private jets emitted
{emissions_tons.claim} tons of CO2e[^5], the equivalent of what **{dane_years.claim} Danes**
emit in a year[^4].

Of these,
* {number_of_legs_less_300km} trips were less than 300 km and could have been replaced by
  a limusine or first class train ticket, which would have emitted ~30-50x less CO2.
* {number_of_legs_more_300km} trips could have been replaced by
  a first class ticket on a commercial aircraft, which would have emitted
  ~{ratio_commercial_300km}x less CO2[^5].

Billionaires and companies alike are incapable of regulating their emissions,
recklessly destroying the common good.
Ban private jets now and until they emit what equivalent means of transportation would emit.

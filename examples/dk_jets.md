# Use of Danish private jets

{from_date} to {to_date}, all Danish private jets emitted
{emissions_tons.claim} tons of CO2e[^1], or what **{dane_years.claim} Danes** emit in a year[^2].
{number_of_private_jets.claim} private jets alone[^3] jeopardize the efforts of millions
of Danes that every day act to reduce their emissions.

Of these,
* {number_of_legs_less_300km} trips were less than 300 km and could have been replaced by
  a limusine or first class train ticket, which would have emitted ~30-50x less CO2.
* {number_of_legs_more_300km} trips could have been replaced by
  a first class ticket on a commercial aircraft, which would have emitted
  ~{ratio_commercial_300km}x less CO2[^5].

The use of private jets by billionaires and large companies alike is an insult
to Danes and Danish companies alike that are doing everything they can to
keep for our future.

# Use of {country.possessive} private jets{location}

Between {from_date} and {to_date}, {country.possessive} private jets{location} emitted
{emissions_tons.claim} tons of CO2e[^1], or what **{citizen_years.claim} {country.plural}** emit in a year[^2].
{number_of_private_jets.claim} private jets alone[^3] jeopardize the efforts of millions
of {country.plural} that every day act to reduce their emissions.

Of these,
* {number_of_legs_less_300km} trips were less than 300 km[^4] and could have been replaced by
  a limusine or first class train ticket, which would have emitted ~{ratio_train_300km.claim}x less CO2[^5].
* {number_of_legs_more_300km} trips[^4] could have been replaced by
  a first class ticket on a commercial aircraft, which would have emitted
  ~{ratio_commercial_300km.claim}x less CO2[^6].

The use of private jets by billionaires and large companies alike is an insult
to {country.plural} and {country.possessive} companies alike that are doing everything they can
to reduce emissions.

> Ban private jets _now_
